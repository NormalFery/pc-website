## Who

We are Pridecraft Studios, a collective of developers making LGBTQ+ content for Minecraft.

We make resource packs and mods to add pride-themed stuff to the game, while trying not to "over-gay".
The main difference when compared to other packs,
is that we know how to keep the game from looking like someone vomited rainbows all over the place.
